### **Why?**

We know little about our parents when they were young. As I find myself quickly hurtling through my 20's, I wanted a place to post my thoughts and musings in the **NOW** so that I can connect with the **FUTURE**. Sometimes it is simply easier to communicate in writing than through speech.

*I hope you, as a reader, can enjoy this open personal journal.*
