*A random list of music I recommend to listen all the way through. They are listed in no particular order.*

I am a proponent of the argument that albums should be listened to all the way through in sequential order. Listening to albums all the way through typically give more meaning and context to each song, and makes the music more enjoyable. Here are some albums I have recently enjoyed listening to all the way.

### 1. [Fine Line - Harry Styles](https://open.spotify.com/album/7xV2TzoaVc0ycW7fwBwAml?si=p4qqSLbITmK5PlBXFk2aQA)
> Tastes like strawberries on a summer evenin' / And it sounds just like a song / I want more berries and that summer feelin' / It's so wonderful and warm

Since One Direction split up, Harry Styles has proven first with *Harry Styles* and now with *Fine Line* that he is the most successful solo-artist of the original fab 5. This album has everything, from songs that make you emotional to songs that will make you get up and dance.

### 2. [Golden Hour - Kacey Musgraves](https://open.spotify.com/album/7f6xPqyaolTiziKf5R5Z0c?si=kMP_6Zl2S1Sg7ubB3RArDA)
> Is there a word for the way that I'm feeling tonight? / Happy and sad at the same time / You got me smiling with tears in my eyes / I never felt so high

If country was never your thing, maybe *Golden Hour* will change your mind. This album won Best Album and Best Country Album for the 2019 Grammys. It is well deserving; this album is beautiful all the way through. Rumor has it Kacey Musgraves wrote this album while on acid -- songs like "Space Cowboy" put a very unique twist on the Country genre. Prepare for a total trip through this album, as each proceeding song seems to trump the one before it.

### 3. [Discovery - Daft Punk](https://open.spotify.com/album/2noRn2Aes5aoNVsU6iWThc?si=74L3YTDVRZe1bnDJMC5VvA)
> I need you more than anything in my life / I want you more than anything in my life / I'll miss you more than anyone in my life / I love you more than anyone in my life

I recently went back and started to listen through Daft Punk's old album, and *Discovery* immediately differentiated itself. This album contains a couple huge hits, such as "One More Time" and "Harder Better Faster Stronger", but it also contains so many more gems such as "Something About Us", "Veridis Quo" (pronouced very-disco), and "Face to Face". Each one of these songs is released with a music video set to an anime theme, a French electronic duo making English music set to Japanese themes. Watching these videos gives each song new meaning, and I highly recommend watching [them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOS9aOIXPEk).

### 4. [Gravity - Gryffin](https://open.spotify.com/album/2IAVHJdaRPFA6MQqXHoG75?si=iHErRFQXSGCWa8TE6A3FSQ)
> Don't you remember / The way that we used to live for each other? / Remember the way we fell for each other / When I was yours and when you were mine / Remember that time

I am not ashamed to admit that I have recently been listening to increasingly more EDM. If you like EDM and you haven't listened to this album all the way through, then you must give it a try. I especially recommend "Remember", "Body Back", and "Tie Me Down".

### 5. [AM - Arctic Monkeys](https://open.spotify.com/album/78bpIziExqiI9qztvNFlQu?si=LQ3gBw48RRCWYmWXCgWLiA)
> Mad sounds in your ears, they make you feel alright / They bring you back to life / Mad sounds in your ears, they make you get up and dance / They make you get up / Yeah, they make you get up

This breakout album by Arctic Monkeys is definitely one of my favorite albums of all time. It is especially profound for me because with this album carries a lot of college memories. I recommend listening to "Mad Sounds" and "I Wanna Be Yours" if you are in the mood to close your eyes and feel the music.
